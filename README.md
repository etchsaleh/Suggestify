# Suggestify
## Discover new music.
**SUGGESTIFY** is a music recommendation desktop application written in Java that provides artist recommendations based on the user's current favorites. The recommender system is implemented using a matrix factorization method named Alternating Least Squares (ALS) which uses a 360k user dataset from last.fm® containing the top 50 most played artists as well as the number of times that artist was played per user. The application later interacts with Spotify® using the [official API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) to create a playlist consisting of top tracks by suggested artists.
